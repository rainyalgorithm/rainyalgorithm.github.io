# GDP and unemployment

Unemployment is in news again, as it should be.

Current establishment has been trying to hide unemployment figures and in fact
denying the existence of high unemployment figures.

One common defense the government and its spokespersons have employed is the prevalence of high GDP. 

Let investigate the weight of that argument. You can watch [Arun Jaitley][jaitley2019video] and
[Rajiv Kumar][kumar2019video] making that claim independently (or presumably so).
